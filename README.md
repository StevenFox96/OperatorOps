You can read more about the **Creator.eco** ecosystem and the different roles it has [here](https://google.com).

**Please Note!**  
> This installation guide supports two installation paths.  
> The first, which is the main path, refer to an installation process of the **CEO Core** components in a production environment, the EOS mainnet.  
> The second path, which is also labled with the word **Testnet** in the relevant places in this guide, refer to an installation process of the **CEO Core** components in a sandbox environment.

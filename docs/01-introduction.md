## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This step-to-step guide will help you to deploy the **Creator.eco Operator Core** components (CEO Core) to EOS mainnet.  
The **CEO Core** are a collection of source code, binaries and configurations that are all operate together to enable the CEO to expose its website to his users.

The **CEO Core** installation process involves among other things a configuration of some 3rd party service providers such as IPFS Pinning service provider and DNS configuration service provider. As we've tested many configurations combinations for the *service providers stack* along the way, we've found that the service providers list below enable the most easy-to-use and configure installation process.

1. [Blockstart Base Package](https://dsphq.io/packages/blockstartac/ipfsservice1/blockpack2) for the DSP (dApp Service Provider) package.  
2. [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) for the IPFS pinning service.  
3. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for the DNS configuration service. 

> Please note!  
> Each of these services has alternatives, and you are welcome to choose other service providers and use them in your personal installation process.

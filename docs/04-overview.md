## Installation Process Overview  

The **Creator.eco Operator** (CEO) installation process consists of 5 major steps:

1. Select a DSP and a DSP package.
2. Stake DAPP tokens to the selected DSP.
3. Deploy the **CEO Core** smart contract to the EOS blockchain.
4. Upload the **CEO Frontend** (the UI part of your web application) to the IPFS network.
5. Configure your DNS to point to your **CEO Frontend**.

As we mentioned earlier, most of the steps in the installation process have been automate using the [**GitHub Actions**](../.github/workflows/ceo-installer.yml) pipeline attached to this repository.
Next in this guide, we'll gather all needed pipeline's inputs and configure the pipeline in order to make it work correctly.
